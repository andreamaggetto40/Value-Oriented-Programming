# **C++ ADT Library**

The current directory contains several header files that contain another implementation for the related data structures used:

* **Linkedin list**
* **Circular linkedin list**
* **Doubly linked list**
* **Set**

Further, the repository also contains an **ArrayList class**, implemented using the same Java standards, transpilled into C++ ones. 

The Linked list class has been refactored, from the original one using **memory pointer** to the usage of a vector as private data structure.

All the data structured above are implemented through the **template**, allowing custom input type for them.
