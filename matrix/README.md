# Matrix.hpp

Matrix.hpp aims to be the standard *de facto* C++ language based library for matrix calculus, with operation described directly from the Linear Algebra field.

### How it is composed

Inside it, there are multiple useful methods either to perform operations on the matrix structure or to gain further Information about it.

From a development glance, the library is split up upon two main units:

* **Matrix** header file: Matrix interface; On the first half of the library, there are class and methods definition. On the second one, the implementation.
* **Testing** file: Simple testing file to check the Matrix library. 

The library contains documentation as well, respecting the C++ standards for building an effective documentation.
